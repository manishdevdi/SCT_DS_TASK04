# SCT_DS_TASK04(Data Science Intern)
## Task : Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The objective is to uncover insights into accident hotspots and contributing factors, helping in understanding and potentially mitigating traffic accidents.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for traffic accident datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualization of accident hotspots using geographical data.
- Analysis of the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day on accident rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on:
- Date and time of the accident
- Location details (latitude, longitude)
- Weather conditions
- Road conditions
- Severity of the accident

The dataset can be sourced from public databases or government repositories that track traffic accidents.
